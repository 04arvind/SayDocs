# TODO: Wave and UI Updates

- [x] Update Waves.jsx to make the wave animation span the full width of the screen (adjust positioning and geometry for full viewport coverage)
- [x] Update font colors in Hero.jsx for better visibility against the background (change text-gray-400 to brighter colors like text-white)
- [x] Update styling of "Start Recording" and "Upload Audio" buttons in Hero.jsx (improve visibility, perhaps add stronger colors or glow effects)
